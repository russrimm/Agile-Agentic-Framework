   Topic: "How does this affect us"
   Trigger phrases:
   - "Impact of [feature] on our tenant"
   - "Do we need to prepare for [update]"
   - "What should we do about [announcement]"
   
   Conversation nodes:
   1. Identify update in question
   2. Analyze tenant configuration
   3. Generate recommendations:
      - Preparation steps
      - Required admin actions
      - Training requirements
      - Timeline suggestions
   ```
