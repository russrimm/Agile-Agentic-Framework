### Step 3: Use Entities to Inform AI Responses

To make AI responses more precise:

1. Define entities to capture specific information from users
2. In AI-generated responses, reference these entities using variables
3. This allows the AI to include user-specific details in its responses

For example, in your prompt, you might include: "The user's name is ${UserName} and they're interested in ${ProductCategory}."

## System Message Configuration

### Step 1: Create an Effective System Message

The system message defines how your AI model should behave:

1. Go back to **Settings** > **AI models**
2. Select your Azure OpenAI connection
3. In the **System message** field, enter instructions for the AI. Example:

```
You are a helpful assistant for [Company Name]. Your purpose is to help customers with questions about our products and services.

When responding to users:
1. Be friendly and professional
2. Keep responses concise and to the point
3. If you don't know something, admit it and offer to connect the user with a human agent
4. Never make up information about our products
5. Focus on answering the specific question asked
6. When discussing our products, emphasize their key benefits

Our company values customer satisfaction above all else.
```

4. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Test and Refine the System Message

1. Test your copilot with various inputs
2. Observe whether the responses align with your instructions
3. Refine the system message to address any issues
