## Creating Custom Actions in Copilot Studio

1. **Create Salesforce Query Action**

   - Click "New action" > "Create from scratch"
   - Name: "QuerySalesforceAccounts"
   - Authentication: Select "SalesforceConnection"
   - Click "Next"

2. **Configure Action Input Parameters**

     - Name: "searchTerm"
     - Type: "String"
   - Click "Next"

     - Name: "accounts"
     - Type: "JSON"
   - Click "Next"

4. **Define HTTP Request**
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `{{ConnectionParameters.instance_url}}/services/data/v56.0/query?q=SELECT Id, Name, Industry, Phone, Type FROM Account WHERE Name LIKE '%{{InputParameters.searchTerm}}%' LIMIT 10`
   - Headers:
     - Key: Authorization
     - Value: Bearer {{ConnectionParameters.access_token}}
   - Click "Save" to complete the action setup

## Implementing Salesforce API Calls

1. **Create a Copilot Topic**
   - Go to "Topics" and click "Add"
   - Create a new topic named "Search Salesforce Accounts"
   - Add trigger phrases:
     - "Find accounts"
     - "Search for accounts"
     - "Look up company"
     - "Find customers"

2. **Build the Conversation Flow**
   - In the Authoring Canvas, add a "User's response" node to capture the search term
   - Set a question: "What company name would you like to search for?"
   - Save the user's response to a variable: "searchTerm"

3. **Call the Salesforce Action**
   - Add a "Call an action" node
   - Select your "QuerySalesforceAccounts" action
   - Map the "searchTerm" variable to the action's input parameter
   - Store the output in a variable: "accountResults"

4. **Process and Display Results**
   - Add a "Condition" node to check if results were found
   - Condition: `length(outputs.accountResults.records) > 0`
   - If true, add a "Show message" node with dynamic content to display the accounts
   - If false, add a "Show message" node stating no accounts were found

5. **Format Account Display**
   - In the success path, use a "Show message" node with the following template:
   ```
   I found the following accounts:
   
   {{forEach(outputs.accountResults.records, account, concat('- ', account.Name, ' (', account.Industry, ') - Phone: ', account.Phone, '\n'))}}
   ```

## Testing the Integration

1. **Test in the Authoring Canvas**
   - Click "Test your Copilot" in the upper right corner
   - Type one of the trigger phrases (e.g., "Find accounts")
   - Enter a search term (e.g., "Global")
   - Verify that the results are displayed correctly

2. **Debug Common Issues**
   - If authentication fails, check your OAuth setup in both Salesforce and Copilot Studio
   - If queries return no results, verify your SOQL query syntax and test it directly in Salesforce Developer Console
   - Check that your connected app permissions are properly configured

3. **Monitor API Usage**
   - In Salesforce, go to Setup > System Overview to monitor API usage
   - Ensure you're not exceeding the Developer Edition API limits

## Best Practices and Governance

1. **Security Considerations**
   - Store sensitive credentials securely in Copilot Studio authentication settings
   - Use IP restrictions in Salesforce when moving to production
   - Implement field-level security in Salesforce to control what data is accessible

2. **Error Handling**
   - Add error handling in your Copilot conversation flows
   - Create fallback options when API calls fail
   - Provide clear user messages for different error scenarios

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Limit the fields returned in your queries to only what's needed
   - Add appropriate LIMIT clauses to your SOQL queries
   - Consider caching frequently accessed data

4. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Set up Application Insights for your Copilot
   - Monitor Salesforce API usage regularly
   - Implement logging for important events and errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Check that your Consumer Key and Secret are correct
   - Verify that your Connected App is properly configured in Salesforce
   - Ensure your user profile has API access

2. **Query Issues**
   - Test your SOQL queries directly in Salesforce Developer Console
   - Verify object and field names are correct and accessible
   - Check for special characters that might need escaping

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Developer Edition has API request limits
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Consider batching requests when possible
