# Performance & Monitoring Guide for Copilot Studio

## Monitoring Setup

- **Azure Application Insights integration**: Connect your Copilot Studio implementation to Azure Application Insights by navigating to the Azure portal, creating a new Application Insights resource, and copying the instrumentation key to the Copilot Studio configuration settings. This enables comprehensive telemetry collection including request rates, response times, and failure rates.

- **Custom telemetry implementation**: Extend the default telemetry by implementing custom event tracking within your solution. Add code to track business-specific events by using the Application Insights SDK to call `trackEvent()` with custom properties and metrics that matter to your implementation.

- **Alert configuration**: Set up proactive notifications by creating alert rules in Azure Monitor that trigger when specific thresholds are exceeded. Configure severity levels, notification channels (email, SMS, webhook), and action groups to ensure the right people are notified at the right time.

- **Dashboard setup**: Create a monitoring dashboard in Azure Portal by selecting the "Dashboard" option and adding Application Insights widgets for key metrics. Include charts for response times, failure rates, user counts, and custom business metrics to provide a unified view of system health.

- **Health checks and monitoring**: Implement automated health checks by creating an endpoint that verifies connectivity to all dependent services. Schedule regular probes using Azure Functions or Logic Apps that call this endpoint and log the results to Application Insights.

## Performance Optimization

- **Response time optimization**: Analyze performance bottlenecks using Application Insights Performance blade to identify slow components. Implement asynchronous processing for non-critical operations, optimize database queries, and consider implementing a command query responsibility segregation (CQRS) pattern for read-heavy operations.

- **Memory usage optimization**: Monitor memory consumption in Azure Monitor metrics. Implement proper object disposal in your code, avoid large in-memory collections, consider using streaming for large data transfers, and implement pagination for large result sets.

- **Network latency reduction**: Deploy resources within the same Azure region as your users, implement content delivery networks (CDNs) for static content, use connection pooling for database connections, and implement compression for API responses to reduce payload sizes.

## Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Implementation

- **Install necessary packages**: Add the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry package to your application by running the appropriate package manager command for your platform. For .NET applications, use `dotnet add package Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.AspNetCore`. For Node.js, use `npm install @azure/monitor-opentelemetry`. For Python, use `pip install azure-monitor-opentelemetry`. For Java, add the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry agent to your JVM arguments.

- **Configure the connection string**: Set up the Application Insights connection string in your application configuration. For .NET Core, add it to your appsettings.json file. For other platforms, use the appropriate environment variable (APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING) or configuration file approach specific to your language.

- **Initialize OpenTelemetry in your application**: Add the Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry provider to your application's startup code. For .NET applications, use `builder.Services.AddAzureMonitor()` in your Program.cs file. For Node.js, create an OpenTelemetry SDK instance with the Azure Monitor exporter. For Python, configure the AzureMonitorTraceExporter. For Java, no additional code is required if using the agent-based approach.

- **Configure sampling rate**: Adjust the sampling percentage based on your application's traffic volume to optimize cost and performance. For high-traffic applications, set a lower sampling rate (e.g., 10-25%) to reduce telemetry volume while maintaining statistical accuracy. Configure this in your application's OpenTelemetry settings.

- **Enable correlation context propagation**: Ensure distributed tracing works across service boundaries by configuring context propagation. This allows you to track requests as they flow through different components of your application. Configure the W3C Trace Context propagator in your OpenTelemetry setup.

- **Add custom dimensions**: Extend the default telemetry by adding custom dimensions to your traces. Use span attributes to add business-specific metadata to your telemetry. For .NET, use Activity Tags. For Node.js, use span.setAttribute(). For Python, use span.set_attribute(). For Java, use Span.current().setAttribute().

- **Configure logging integration**: Connect your application's logging framework to OpenTelemetry to ensure logs are correlated with traces. For .NET, use the ILogger integration. For Node.js, configure Winston or Pino with OpenTelemetry. For Python, set up integration with your logging module. For Java, configure Log4j or Logback with OpenTelemetry.

## Copilot Studio Analytics and Reporting

### Built-in Analytics Dashboard

- **Dashboard overview**: Access comprehensive analytics by navigating to your Copilot Studio environment and selecting "Analytics" from the left navigation menu. The built-in dashboard provides insights into conversation volumes, session metrics, user satisfaction, and topic effectiveness without requiring any additional configuration.

- **Key performance indicators**: Monitor essential metrics including total conversation count, average conversation duration, resolution rate, and abandonment percentage. These KPIs are displayed on the main analytics dashboard and can be filtered by time period, channel, and user segments.

- **User satisfaction tracking**: Analyze end-user feedback collected through post-conversation surveys. View satisfaction scores, identify trends over time, and correlate satisfaction ratings with specific topics or conversation patterns to drive continuous improvement initiatives.

- **Topic effectiveness analysis**: Evaluate the performance of individual topics by analyzing trigger rates, completion rates, and escalation percentages. Use the topic details view to identify underperforming topics that require optimization or additional training phrases.

### Transcript Analytics in Dataverse

- **Transcript data access**: Access detailed conversation data through Dataverse tables in your Microsoft Power Platform environment. Use Power Apps, Power BI, or custom applications to query and analyze this data for deeper insights beyond the built-in analytics dashboard.

- **Primary transcript tables**: Understand the core tables that store conversation data:
  - **msdyn_conversationtranscript**: Contains full conversation history with timestamps, user and agent messages, and session metadata.
  - **msdyn_conversationparticipant**: Stores information about participants in each conversation including customer and agent identifiers.
  - **msdyn_conversationinsight**: Captures insights derived from conversations including sentiment analysis, key phrases, and AI-detected patterns.
  - **msdyn_conversationtopic**: Records which topics were triggered during conversations and their outcomes.
  - **msdyn_conversationsessionparameter**: Stores session-specific parameters and context variables that were used during conversations.
  - **msdyn_conversationaction**: Contains information about actions taken during conversations, such as authenticated operations or Power Automate flow executions.

- **Message-level details**: Access individual message data through the following tables:
  - **msdyn_conversationmessageblock**: Contains individual message blocks exchanged during conversations.
  - **msdyn_conversationmessage**: Stores detailed message content with message type classification.
  - **msdyn_conversationquery**: Records specific user queries and the system's interpretation of user intent.
