3. Create a Power Automate flow node:
   - Click the plus sign to add a node
   - Select **Power Automate flow**
   - Click **Create a flow**

### Step 3: Create the Task Analysis Flow

1. In the Power Automate flow creation window:
   - Name your flow: "Analyze User Request"
   - Use the trigger: "When a topic flow calls a Power Automate flow"

2. Add an action: **Azure OpenAI** > **Completions**
   - Connection name: Create a new connection to your Azure OpenAI
   - Deployment: Select your GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 deployment
   - Prompt: 
     ```
     You are an autonomous agent tasked with analyzing user requests and determining the necessary actions to fulfill them.

     USER REQUEST: {{triggerBody()['text']['UserRequest']}}

     Please analyze this request and provide:
     1. A clear understanding of what the user wants to accomplish
     2. The specific actions needed to complete this task
     3. Any additional information you would need from the user
     4. A step-by-step plan for completing the task

     Format your response as JSON with the following structure:
     {
         "understanding": "Brief description of what you understand the user wants",
         "required_actions": ["action1", "action2"],
         "missing_information": ["info1", "info2"],
         "execution_plan": "Step-by-step plan",
         "doable": true/false
     }
     ```

3. Add a Parse JSON action:
   - Content: Output from the OpenAI completions step
   - Schema: Click "Generate from sample" and use:
     ```json
     {
         "understanding": "The user wants to schedule a meeting with the marketing team for tomorrow at 2 PM",
         "required_actions": ["Check calendar availability", "Create calendar event", "Send invites to team members"],
         "missing_information": ["List of attendees", "Meeting duration"],
         "execution_plan": "1. Check calendar availability for tomorrow at 2 PM\n2. Create calendar event\n3. Add required attendees\n4. Set meeting duration\n5. Include meeting agenda\n6. Send invites",
         "doable": true
     }
     ```

4. Add a "Return value to Copilot Studio" action:
   - Understanding: `understanding` from the Parse JSON step
   - RequiredActions: `required_actions` from Parse JSON
   - MissingInfo: `missing_information` from Parse JSON

2. After the Power Automate flow node, add a condition:
   - If `PowerAutomateResponse.IsDoable` equals `true`, follow the "Yes" branch
   - Otherwise, follow the "No" branch

3. In the "Yes" branch:
   - Add a message: `I understand that you want to {{PowerAutomateResponse.Understanding}}.`
   - Add a message: `Here's my plan to help you:`
   - Add a message: `{{PowerAutomateResponse.ExecutionPlan}}`

4. Create a condition to check if missing information exists:
   - Use the expression: `length(PowerAutomateResponse.MissingInfo) > 0`
   - In the "Yes" branch, add a message:
     ```
     Before I can proceed, I need some additional information:
     {{PowerAutomateResponse.MissingInfo}}
     ```
   - Add nodes to collect the missing information

5. In the "No" branch (when task is not doable):
   - Add a message: `I understand that you want to {{PowerAutomateResponse.Understanding}}, but I'm unable to complete this task autonomously. Here's why:`
   - Add a message explaining the limitations
   - Offer alternatives: `Would you like me to help with something else instead?`
