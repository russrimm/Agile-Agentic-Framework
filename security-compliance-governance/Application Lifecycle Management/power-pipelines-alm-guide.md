   - **Per solution**: Each solution deploys independently
   - Configure under **Settings** â†’ **Advanced settings** â†’ **Solution import behavior**

3. **Solution Versioning Strategy**:
   - Implement semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)
   - Configure automatic version increments in source control
   - Example PowerShell script for auto-versioning:
     ```powershell
     # Increment patch version in solution.xml
     $solutionXml = Get-Content .\SolutionPackage\src\Other\Solution.xml
     $versionPattern = 'Version="(\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+)"'
     $versionMatch = [regex]::Match($solutionXml, $versionPattern)
     if ($versionMatch.Success) {
         $major = $versionMatch.Groups[1].Value
         $minor = $versionMatch.Groups[2].Value
         $build = $versionMatch.Groups[3].Value
         $revision = [int]$versionMatch.Groups[4].Value + 1
         $newVersion = "Version=`"$major.$minor.$build.$revision`""
         $solutionXml = $solutionXml -replace $versionPattern, $newVersion
         $solutionXml | Set-Content .\SolutionPackage\src\Other\Solution.xml
     }
     ```
