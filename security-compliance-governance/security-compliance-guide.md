This guide provides a high-level overview of security and compliance considerations for Microsoft Copilot Studio. For detailed information on specific aspects, please refer to the [Microsoft Copilot Studio Security and Governance Documentation](./copilot-studio-security-governance.md).

## Environment Security and Management

### Environment Segregation
- **Development environment setup**: Establish isolated development environments with restricted data access using separate Copilot Studio instances for each development team. Implement development-specific content filtering rules and limit connector access to non-production resources.
- **Test environment configuration**: Configure test environments with production-like security settings but using anonymized data. Implement comprehensive logging for testing activities and maintain separate user access lists for QA personnel.
- **Production environment security**: Apply strict access controls with just-in-time privileged access. Implement comprehensive auditing, automated security scanning, and regular vulnerability assessments. Enforce mandatory approval workflows for all production changes.
- **Data isolation between environments**: Utilize separate data stores for each environment with no cross-environment data flow. Implement network segmentation using virtual networks and security groups, and establish clear data classification policies for each environment.

### Access Control
- **Microsoft Entra ID integration**: Configure Copilot Studio to use Microsoft Entra ID as the identity provider with conditional access policies. Implement group-based access assignments and enable identity protection features for threat detection. See the [Entra Application Registration](#entra-application-registration) section for detailed configuration guidance.
